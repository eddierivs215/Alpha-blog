    <p>My name is Edward Rivera and I am currently writing a program to try out 
       some of the things I've learned throughout this course. Now that I realize
       I'm writing out an 'About Us' section, I don't really know what is the point
       of this blog. That's pretty Alpha. We are all pretty Alpha.
